# Blogs helper

A Chrome extension that helps you to note down the important things temporarily while reading the technical blogs and other informative things.


# What Blogs helper solves ? 

The Problem statement I took was simple and weird , not sure how many of them faced it but to be honest I faced a lot. 

```While reading the technical blogs there will be a code snipet at the starting of the blog which will be refrenced and explained till the bottom of the blogs. As we go on scrolling the page the actual code snipet which is refrenced will be hidden in the viewport.```

Now while reading the explanation I've forgot the actual code snipet. 

....What is this blog explaining ðŸ¤” .... 

So to overcome that I've used multiple window one for the code snipet and other one is for the explanation . This is not the perfect way right ? Why not stickys ? Not sure how to use without minimizing the browser. So to overcome that I've made Blogs helper.
